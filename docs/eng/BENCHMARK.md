# qeli load testing

The data was collected **2026-06-11** on a freshly rebooted 2-VM lab, the release
binary (LTO=fat, strip, panic=abort), version **0.6.0**, SHA-256 `b7d8199c812d097e…`.
Raw results — [release/benchmark_results.json](../../release/benchmark_results.json),
the orchestrator — [scripts/benchmark.py](../../scripts/benchmark.py).

> Release **0.6.0** is a refactoring (the shared C# layer, .NET 10, cleanup); the
> protocol, crypto, and data plane were **unchanged**. A direct measurement of 0.6.0
> confirmed this: on a clean lab it runs at/above the 0.5.6 reference (the 2026-06-07

> much). The 0.5.6 reference is kept alongside in
> `release/benchmark_results_2026-06-07_v0.5.6.json`.

> 🆕 **Version 0.7.0** (2026-06-12) — a large core refactor (PQ-derive/ml-kem, the
> hand-rolled realtls server, the kill-switch, reality-hardening). The measurements and

>
> **0.7.0** (the post-quantum tunnel + the audit 2026-06-11): the X25519+ML-KEM hybrid
> affects only the handshake (a one-time cost on connect), throughput is unchanged — a

## The rig

| parameter | value |
|---|---|
| Server | `10.66.116.10`, Debian 13, kernel 6.12.88, 2 vCPU (QEMU, AES-NI present), NIC virtio |
| Client | `10.66.116.11`, identical, the same L2 network |
| iperf3 | 3.18 |
| TUN MTU | 1400 in all modes |
| Cipher / KEX | ChaCha20-Poly1305 / X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 (reality-tls: the outer TLS — AES-128-GCM) |

**Methodology.** For each mode we bring up a **separate tunnel** (a flat-INI config of
the server + client), `ping -c 20 -i 0.2`, then `iperf3 -t 12` in both directions for
TCP, or a sweep `iperf3 -u -b {100..500}M -l 1200` for UDP. CPU is taken via
`iperf3 cpu_utilization_percent` (host=the iperf client, remote=the iperf server, % of
2 vCPU) **and** by sampling the `qeli` process on the server.

> ⚠️ The numbers have a spread of ±3–5% between runs (a virtio VM). For pristine numbers
> run on a **freshly rebooted** lab: a background load on the .11 client (e.g. the stock
> Android emulator `qemu -avd test`, ~17% CPU) **inflates UDP loss** at 400–500 Mbps
> several-fold (the open-loop receiver is CPU-starved) and slightly lowers TCP — before a
> benchmark `python scripts/reboot_vms.py`. This run is without drops, `ping` 0% in all
> modes.

> 🔴 **IMPORTANT about the `qeli CPU` columns below.** They were taken with `ps %cpu` =
> an average over the WHOLE life of the process → they **greatly underestimate** (showing
> ~34%). A precise delta measurement by `/proc/<pid>/stat` over the load window
> ([scripts/multicore_probe.py](../../scripts/multicore_probe.py)) gives **~150% = ~1.5
> cores** on ONE tunnel: the data plane is **multi-core** (the decrypt-reader +
> encrypt-writer + TUN-pump are independent tokio tasks on different cores), not "one
> core". The `qeli CPU` columns in the tables are only a relative comparison of the modes
> against each other, NOT the absolute core load.

## Version 0.7.0 (2026-06-12) — the delta to 0.6.0

A large core refactor (`+1484/−327` lines: the PQ `crypto/derive`+`mlkem`, the
hand-rolled realtls server `protocol/tls`, `server/{handler,mod,dns,reality}`,
`client/killswitch`). The binary `qeli 0.7.0` sha `5e40e697`, a freshly rebooted lab,
the gate PASS (build + **191 tests** + clippy). The raw data —
[release/benchmark_results_2026-06-12_v0.7.0.json](../../release/benchmark_results_2026-06-12_v0.7.0.json),
the 0.6.0 reference alongside in `benchmark_results_2026-06-11_v0.6.0.json`.

### ⚠️ Two breaking config changes (accounted for in [benchmark.py](../../scripts/benchmark.py))

1. **Persistent TOFU** — the server key pin is now stored on disk
   (`/var/lib/qeli/known_hosts`), not in the session memory. A stale pin on `host:port`
   survives a reboot and **rejects the connect** with a fresh bench key → the harness
   wipes it before each mode.
2. **`reality_proxy` requires `short_ids`** — the trivially probeable fallback by the
   absence of ALPN was removed; `reality_proxy.enabled` without `short_ids` is **rejected
   at startup** (the worker in a respawn loop → connection refused). The bench tcp-reality:
   the server gets `short_ids`, the client (fake-tls) gets `reality_sid` + the key pin
   (fake-tls seals the sid in the session_id). Additive: `kill_switch`, `peek_timeout_ms`;
   the default `handrolled` switched false→true (real_tls-reality is now hand-rolled, not
   rustls).

### TCP, Mbps (↑up / ↓down)

| mode | 0.6.0 ↑/↓ | 0.7.0 ↑/↓ | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| plain | 571 / 714 | 555 / 700 | −2.8% / −2.0% |
| fake-tls | 563 / 697 | 527 / 693 | −6.4% / −0.6% |
| padding | 559 / 704 | 528 / 686 | −5.5% / −2.5% |
| frag | 554 / 702 | 533 / 664 | −3.8% / −5.4% |
| obfs | 498 / 582 | 482 / 568 | −3.1% / −2.5% |
| reality (proxy) | 577 / 721 | 552 / 688 | −4.3% / −4.7% |
| **reality-tls** (5× median) | 488 / 321 | 482 / **417** | −1.2% / **+30%** |

### UDP, loss % (400M / 500M)

| mode | 0.6.0 | 0.7.0 |
|---|---|---|
| udp-fake-tls | 0.35 / 2.97 | 0.20 / 2.98 |
| udp-padding | 0.41 / 3.22 | 0.31 / 3.32 |
| udp-quic | 0.25 / 4.08 | 0.45 / 4.28 |

### reality-tls × 5 runs

- **↑ up:** 0.6.0 median 488 (σ37) → 0.7.0 **482** (σ99, spread 437–688) — the same, a higher spread.
- **↓ down:** 0.6.0 **321** (σ2.4) → 0.7.0 **417** (σ3.4) — **+30%, both stable → a real gain**
  (the hand-rolled TLS server in the new default is faster than rustls + the `protocol/tls` refactor).
  The raw data — [release/reality_tls_5x_v0.7.0_2026-06-12.json](../../release/reality_tls_5x_v0.7.0_2026-06-12.json).

### The precise data-plane CPU (the /proc delta, both binaries back-to-back)

`scripts/multicore_probe.py` — the worker's true CPU by `/proc/<pid>/stat` (not `ps`).
0.6.0 was built in isolation from the committed HEAD ([scripts/probe_060_ab.py](../../scripts/probe_060_ab.py)).

| 1 tunnel | 0.6.0 | 0.7.0 |
|---|---:|---:|
| upload (decrypt) | 146% (1.46 cores) | 153% (1.53 cores) |
| download (encrypt) | 149% (1.49) | 153% (1.53) |
| bidir | 154% @218↑/217↓ | 154% @140↑/138↓ |

The real cost of the refactor on the data plane — **~+3–5% CPU/core per tunnel** (NOT
+15%, as it seemed from the `ps %cpu` sampler in benchmark.py — it's a lifetime-average
and inflates the delta; trust the /proc probe). In production (1-core-bound, ceiling
~311 Mbps) this is **−3–5% of the ceiling (~295–300 Mbps)** — moderate. A nuance: the
bidir CPU is the same, but the throughput is 218→140 at the same saturation of 2 cores —
a slight efficiency dip under a bidirectional load (a noisy sample).

### The 0.7.0 conclusion

Single-stream throughput **with no significant regression** (TCP in the virtio noise,
UDP unchanged); **reality-tls download +30%**; the data-plane CPU **+3–5%**. The detailed
per-mode 0.6.0 numbers below — the reference base.

## Version 0.7.1 (2026-06-12) — the delta to 0.7.0

More core changes on top of 0.7.0 (`protocol/packet.rs`, `client/dns`, `crypto/derive`,
**H-1** — below) + the default configs were rewritten. The binary `qeli 0.7.1` sha `6f997202`,
a freshly rebooted lab, the gate PASS (build + **194 tests** + clippy). Raw data —
[release/benchmark_results_2026-06-12_v0.7.1.json](../../release/benchmark_results_2026-06-12_v0.7.1.json).

### ⚠️ New wire-breaking: H-1 (`bind_static_to_session`, default true)

Since 0.7.1 the session KDF additionally folds in the static-ephemeral DH (Noise-IK): a
failed ephemeral RNG alone no longer exposes the tunnel. Default `true` on BOTH the server
and the client — it **requires pinning the server key**; a TOFU / legacy-0.7.0 client is
rejected. Pairs with `require_client_key_proof = true`. benchmark.py pins the key in EVERY
mode (otherwise the TOFU modes fail, as before with the persistent-TOFU known_hosts). The
default configs already account for it.

### Default-config functionality (e2e on 0.7.1)

A live run of every shipped default config ([scripts/config_functest.py](../../scripts/config_functest.py)):

| config | result |
|---|---|
| **server.conf** (fake-tls, full stack: NAT/DNS/padding/frag/heartbeat/H-1) | ✅ **PASS** — Auth OK, ping gw, **565 Mbps** |
| **server-maxobf.conf** (reality-tls: real_tls + hand-rolled, require_proof, H-1) | ✅ **PASS** — Auth OK, ping gw, **527 Mbps** |
| parse server.conf / server-maxobf.conf / client.conf / client-maxobf.conf / client-reality-tls.conf | ✅ OK |

Fixed a template bug in `client-maxobf.conf` (it was inconsistent with server-maxobf.conf:
user `phone`≠`client1`, mode `fake-tls`≠real_tls) → `user=client1`, `mode=reality-tls`,
`+reality_sid`; verified e2e. `client-reality-tls.conf` / `client-YOUR_DEPLOY_HOST.conf` point
at an external server (parse only).

### TCP, Mbps (↑up / ↓down)

| mode | 0.7.0 ↑/↓ | 0.7.1 ↑/↓ | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| plain | 555 / 700 | 549 / 717 | −1% / +2% |
| fake-tls | 527 / 693 | 538 / 685 | +2% / −1% |
| padding | 528 / 686 | 550 / 706 | +4% / +3% |
| frag | 533 / 664 | 540 / 674 | +1% / +2% |
| obfs | 482 / 568 | 501 / 579 | +4% / +2% |
| reality (proxy) | 552 / 688 | 559 / 689 | +1% / ≈0 |
| **reality-tls** (5× median) | 482 / 417 | **518 / 418** | **+7% / ≈0** |

### UDP, loss % (400M / 500M)

| mode | 0.7.0 | 0.7.1 |
|---|---|---|
| udp-fake-tls | 0.32 / 2.95 | 0.32 / 2.95 |
| udp-padding | 0.31 / 3.32 | 0.44 / 11.68¹ |
| udp-quic | 0.45 / 4.28 | 0.20 / 2.37 |

¹ a spike at the saturation knee (400M = 0.44%; fake-tls/quic 500M = 2.4–3%) — noise, not a regression.

### reality-tls × 5 — upload stabilization

- **↑ up:** 0.7.0 median 482 (**σ 99**, spread 437–688) → 0.7.1 median **518** (**σ 19**, 498–551):
  upload is both faster (+7%) and **much more stable** — the "jumpy" 0.7.0 upload is cured.
- **↓ down:** 417 → **418** (σ 5.5) — stable. Raw data —
  [release/reality_tls_5x_v0.7.1_2026-06-12.json](../../release/reality_tls_5x_v0.7.1_2026-06-12.json).

### The 0.7.1 conclusion

No regression (0.7.1 ≈ 0.7.0, mostly slightly higher) despite the packet/dns/derive changes
and H-1; the data-plane CPU is the same (the precise /proc measurement of 0.7.0 = 1.53 cores,
the data-plane core was unchanged). The notable improvement — **reality-tls upload
stabilization** (σ 99→19). Both default server configs are functional end-to-end.

## The baseline (without VPN)

| | throughput | loss | CPU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| TCP direct `.11→.10` | **20,972 Mbps** | — | recv 99% (CPU-bound, not the network) |
| UDP @ 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | 0.16% | — |
| UDP @ 1 Gbps | **1000 Mbps** | 0.10% | — |

## TCP — all modes

`up` = client→server (decrypt on the server), `down` = server→client (`iperf3 -R`,
decrypt on the client). `qeli CPU` — the busiest qeli process on the server (% of ONE
core, average/peak over the up run). `RSS` — the resident memory of the worker.

| mode | ↑ up Mbps | ↓ down Mbps | RTT avg | retr ↑/↓ | qeli CPU ↑ avg/peak | RSS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **tcp-plain** (raw, no obfuscation) | 570.8 | 714.3 | 1.24 ms | 619 / 664 | 34.6% / 60.6% | 7.3 MB |
| **tcp-fake-tls** (TLS mimicry) | 562.9 | 697.1 | 1.37 ms | 400 / 53 | 34.2% / 60.1% | 7.8 MB |
| **tcp-padding** (+ random padding) | 558.7 | 704.0 | 1.38 ms | 161 / 695 | 35.4% / 62.6% | 7.9 MB |
| **tcp-frag** (+ fragmentation) | 553.8 | 701.9 | 1.30 ms | 454 / 1063 | 34.3% / 60.3% | 7.5 MB |
| **tcp-obfs** (ChaCha20 stream + WS-fronting) | 497.6 | 582.4 | 1.29 ms | 1463 / 755 | 34.1% / 59.6% | 7.7 MB |
| **tcp-reality** (proxy-bridge, fake-TLS) | **577.2** | **721.4** | 1.37 ms | 1215 / 774 | 34.4% / 61.1% | 7.7 MB |
| **tcp-reality-tls** (real TLS 1.3) | 488¹ | **321** | 1.32 ms | 1612 / 373 | 31.8% / 56.6% | 8.3 MB |

> ¹ `reality-tls` ↑ is highly variable (5 runs: average **470 ± 37** Mbps, median
> **488**, range 421–511) — the heaviest mode, a spread on a single 12-sec run;
> ↓ is **stable 321 ± 2.4**. The row shows the median run (see
> [release/reality_tls_5x_2026-06-11.json](../../release/reality_tls_5x_2026-06-11.json),
> [scripts/reality_tls_repeat.py](../../scripts/reality_tls_repeat.py)).

**Reading:**
- **`plain` ≈ `fake-tls`** (571 vs 563 ↑; 714 vs 697 ↓): the bare tunnel and fake-TLS
  give the same speed — the fake-TLS handshake is one-time, and the framing difference
  (3 bytes/packet) is in the noise. Removing obfuscation does **not** raise throughput
  (the bottleneck is the AEAD).
- **Obfuscation is almost free** on fake-tls: padding/fragmentation/heartbeat within the
  noise.
- **`obfs` ~−12% ↑ / −16% ↓** (498/582 vs 563/697): the cost of the ChaCha20-XOR over the
  whole flow (double encryption).
- **`reality` (proxy) ≈ `fake-tls`** (even the top by throughput: 577/721): peek-and-decide
  once per TCP accept.
- **`reality-tls` — the cost of real TLS, especially on download** (488 ↑ / **321 ↓**).
  See the analysis below.
- The data plane is **multi-core** (the `/proc/stat` delta measurement, not `ps`): one
  tunnel ~1.5 cores, the load from many clients spreads across the cores. Since the
  version with **`tun.queues`** (multi-queue TUN, default auto=nproc — see [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md))
  the TUN pump itself is parallelized too — a controlled A/B gives **+18% aggregate** with
  2 tunnels, single-flow unchanged (in detail — the [Multi-queue TUN](#multi-queue-tun-tunqueues--ab)
  section below). Memory — **~7–8 MB** RSS. RTT overhead ≈ **1.6–1.9 ms**.

## UDP — all modes (a sweep by bitrate, % loss)

| mode | 100M | 200M | 300M | 400M | 500M | sustained bandwidth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **udp-faketls** (fake-tls, the UDP base) | 0% | 0.05% | 0.06% | 0.35% | 2.97% | **~400 Mbps** (<0.5% up to 400) |
| **udp-padding** | 0% | 0% | 0.14% | 0.41% | 3.22% | ~400 Mbps |
| **udp-quic** (masking) | 0% | 0% | 0.09% | 0.25% | 4.08% | ~400 Mbps |

The UDP plane is clean (<0.15%) up to 300 Mbps, holds ~400 at <0.5% loss, saturates
around 500 (3–4% loss). `plain`/`obfs`/`reality*` — TCP only.

> NB: these UDP numbers are from a **clean** (freshly rebooted) lab. Under a background
> load on the .11 client the loss at 400–500 Mbps balloons several-fold (400M→~8%,
> 500M→~22%) — that's CPU starvation of the open-loop receiver, **not** a degradation of
> the data plane (see ⚠️ above).

### Why there's no `plain` on UDP (by design)

`plain` (raw) is TCP-only, and this is a deliberate decision, not a gap in the tests
(the server rejects `mode = plain` + `transport = udp` at startup, see `server/mod.rs`).
Two reasons:

1. **It wouldn't give speed.** The bottleneck is the AEAD (ChaCha20-Poly1305), not the
   5-byte fake-TLS header per datagram. The same conclusion as for TCP
   (`plain ≈ fake-tls`): removing the wrapper doesn't raise throughput.
2. **It's worse for circumvention.** Raw UDP is a high-entropy flow with no structure,
   i.e. exactly the "fully encrypted traffic" signature by which DPI (GFW/TSPU) throttles
   UDP. `udp-faketls`, on the contrary, provides cover (the datagrams look like TLS
   records). So raw UDP would be a **red flag**, not masking.

So for UDP the base mode is `fake-tls` (the rows above), and it is exactly that which is
benchmarked as "UDP without extra obfuscation".

## reality-tls download: why ~320 and what to do about it (analyzed on the lab)

The tunnel in `reality-tls` runs **inside** real TLS 1.3 (rustls on the server, the
hand-rolled `realtls` on the client). On **download** the client reader strips **two
layers sequentially**: the outer TLS record (AES-128-GCM) **and** the inner qeli record
(ChaCha20-Poly1305), with double framing — in a single task. This roughly halves the
download relative to single-layer modes (~700 → ~320).

What has been verified by measurement (a lab diagnosis):
- **AES-NI on the VM is present** (not software-AES).
- The client `qeli` process at reality-tls download peaks at **~67% of one core** (not
  100%) — i.e. this is **not** a pure CPU ceiling, but a combination of double AEAD +
  double framing + await overhead in one reader task.
- **Download is deterministic** (5 runs 2026-06-11: **321 ± 2.4** Mbps), while upload is
  variable (**470 ± 37**, range 421–511): ↓ is bound by the stable two-layer decrypt
  cadence, ↑ fluctuates due to retransmits of the outer TLS under load.

**What did NOT help:** the optimization of the client read path
`RealTlsStream::poll_read` (batch-decrypt of all ready records in one poll, a 64-KiB read
buffer instead of 4-KiB, a cursor instead of a per-record `drain`+allocation) — correct
and kept in the code (161 tests green), but it didn't move the download (317 → 322 → 309
→ 319 Mbps — within the noise), since the bottleneck is **not** in buffering/syscalls.

**The real directions (follow-up, design changes):**
1. **Remove the redundant inner AEAD in reality-tls** — the outer TLS already encrypts
   and authenticates, the inner ChaCha20 on the data plane duplicates this. Inside
   reality-tls the data can be pushed in `plain`/Raw framing (without the second AEAD),
   keeping the qeli handshake/auth — this roughly halves the client's work on download. A
   decision with a security trade-off (defence-in-depth), it requires explicit agreement.
2. **Parallelize the two crypto layers** across tasks/cores (the TLS-decrypt in one, the
   inner in another).

For most scenarios ~320 Mbps download for reality-tls is enough; this is the price for
"real TLS on the wire"-level DPI resistance (it closes tells 1.1–1.6, see
[DPI-AUDIT.md](DPI-AUDIT.md)).

## Multi-queue TUN (`tun.queues`) — A/B

**How it works.** `tun.queues` (per-profile, default `0` = auto = `nproc`) sets how many
`IFF_MULTI_QUEUE` queues are opened on a single TUN device. The data plane pumps them
with N independent reader/forwarder/writer tasks (tokio), and **the kernel RSS-spreads the
outgoing TUN packets across the queues by flow**. This parallelizes the TUN pump itself
(previously — a single reader+forwarder+writer funnel ~1.5 cores) in addition to the
already-multi-core per-connection AEAD. `1` = the old single-threaded pump (for
rollback). UDP is parallelized via N workers on `SO_REUSEPORT` sockets. Nothing changes
on the wire, clients need no rebuild (TUN is a local OS-kernel interface).

**The measurement.** A controlled A/B on a 2-core lab: 2 tunnels in separate netns, a
simultaneous upload, the server worker's CPU — the delta by `/proc/<pid>/stat` (it can
exceed 100%), the host — the delta by `/proc/stat`. The orchestrator —
[scripts/multitunnel_probe.py](../../scripts/multitunnel_probe.py) (`QELI_TUN_QUEUES=1|2`).

| | `queues=1` (legacy) | `queues=2` (multi-queue) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **1 tunnel**, aggregate | 458 Mbps | 455 Mbps | ≈0% |
| **2 tunnels**, aggregate | 607 Mbps | **718 Mbps** | **+18%** |
| qeli CPU @2 tun. (% of one core) | 159% | 167% | takes more of a core |
| threads in the worker | 9 | 11 | +2 queue readers |
| server-host @2 tun. (% of all cores) | 93% | 95% | saturated |

**Reading:**
- **A single stream isn't sped up by the queues** (458 ≈ 455 Mbps): a single TCP is bound
  by its per-connection decrypt task (~1 core), not the TUN pump — N queues have nothing
  to spread. So the per-segment benchmark above (one tunnel per mode) does **not** show a
  multi-queue gain — that's by design, not a regression.
- **The aggregate of many tunnels is sped up**: 607 → 718 Mbps (**+18%**); qeli mean-while
  pulls more of a core (159→167%) and raises +2 reader threads on the queues.
- **+18% is a lower bound**: both 2-tunnel runs hit host saturation (93–95% of all cores),
  since the `iperf3` sink runs on the SAME 2-core server and eats the free cores. On a
  production server with a remote sink and more cores the gain grows with the number of
  cores/clients.

**Conclusion:** `tun.queues=auto` — a free default (single-flow unchanged, the aggregate
under load is faster); set `=1` only for debugging/rollback.

## Final summary

| The cost of `reality-tls` | −13% ↑ (median), **−54% ↓** (nested TLS) | — |
| `plain` (raw) | ≈ fake-tls | n/a (TCP-only) |

The fastest and cheapest on CPU is `plain`/`fake-tls`; the price for DPI resistance is
paid by `obfs` (moderately) and `reality-tls` (noticeably on download).

## Reproduction

```bash
# from a local machine (paramiko); flat-INI configs, write to /etc/qeli/bench-*.conf.
# H-1 (0.7.1): benchmark.py pins the server key in every mode.
python scripts/reboot_vms.py         # a clean lab (reboot both VMs) — before pristine numbers
python scripts/benchmark.py          # baseline + 10 modes × {ping, iperf, CPU/RSS} ≈ 8 min
python scripts/reality_tls_repeat.py # reality-tls ×5 → median/σ (release/reality_tls_5x_*.json)
python scripts/config_functest.py    # default-config functionality: e2e server.conf + server-maxobf.conf + parse all
python scripts/multicore_probe.py    # the precise data-plane CPU (/proc delta: idle/up/down/bidir)
python scripts/probe_060_ab.py       # the CPU A/B vs the previous version (isolated build from git HEAD)
```
The results → `release/benchmark_results.json` and `release/*_v0.7.1_*.json`.
